= The Acts As Taggable Mixin

== Installation

To install or update the gem, simply execute:

gem install acts_as_taggable

To use the 'acts_as_taggable' library in your Rails application after installing
the gem, add this line at the end of your 'config/environment.rb' file:

require_gem 'acts_as_taggable'

== Usage Instructions

To use the acts_as_taggable mixin with your ActiveRecord objects, you must use
a normalized database schema for tagging (also know as folksnomies).

This means that you must have a table solely for holding tag names. Usually, 
this table is named 'tags' having at least 2 columns: primary key (usually
an autoincrement integer called 'id' - the AR standard for PKs) and a 'name'
columns, usually a varchar. You must also have a defined ActiveRecord model 
class that relates to this table, by default called 'Tag'.

For associating tags to your objects you also must have join tables that are
composed of at least 2 columns: the tags table foreign key (by default 'tag_id')
and your taggable object table foreign key.

If youre using the simple has_and_belongs_to_many model, you must NOT have a 
primary key (usually an 'id' column) defined on the join table. If youre using 
a full join model, you must add a primary key column to the join table. Please 
see the RDoc documentation on acts_as_taggable macro and the :join_class_name 
option for the differences between these two approaches.

For example, suppose you are tagging photos and you hold your photo data thru
the Photo model and on the 'photos' table. Your database schema would look
something like this (example suited for MySQL):

CREATE TABLE `tags` (                    
          `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,  
          `name` varchar(255) default NULL,      
          PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)                    
        )

CREATE TABLE `photos_tags` (                    
          `tag_id` int(11) NOT NULL,  
          `photo_id` int(11) NOT NULL      
        )

CREATE TABLE `photos` (                              
          `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,              
          `title` varchar(255) default NULL,                 
          `author_name` varchar(255) default NULL,           
          `image_path` varchar(255) default NULL,                   
          PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)                                
        )                

You would normally define 2 models to relate to these tables:

class Tag < ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_taggable
end

Now you can easily apply and search for tags on photos in your Rails application.

This assumes youre using only default naming conventions. For using the mix-in
with non-standard naming conventions, please see the proper RDoc documentation.

== Upgrading to 2.0

The new version now uses the Rails standard join table names. In the past it was always prefixed by tags, 
independent of the alphabetical order.

If you would like to upgrade without changing your table names, or if you prefer the other style - modify 
your models as follows


class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_taggable
end

becomes

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_taggable :join_table => "tags_photos"
end

== Testing

I'm currently working on overhauling the testing system. You now can point the plugin at a database of your choosing by copying config.yml.sample to the main directory and pointing it at a database that exists. I'll be working on making it easier to switch between MySQL & PostgreSQL to simplify testing.

The tests are still pretty weak. If you really want to help the project - submit tests that show how you are actually using the software so I can confirm that new versions don't break anything.

== Bugs/Patches

This plugin has a site at http://rubyforge.org/projects/taggable/.  Please go there to submit patches or bug reports. This is also the best place to find the latest version of the software.
